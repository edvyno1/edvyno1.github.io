        - Started traveling because he wanted to find his old teacher, Mr. A. Nobel (the mentor of Hephaestus and Vulkan, and also their father figure in the organization). Before going missing, Mr. Nobel left a mysterious letter containing important information about the REDACTED and hinting that he may be hiding out in Amul and asking him to meet a contact of his in the Green Islands.
